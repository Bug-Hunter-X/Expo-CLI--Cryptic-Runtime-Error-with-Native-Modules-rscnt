This error typically occurs when you're using a feature from a library that's not properly linked or configured within your Expo project.  A common scenario involves using a native module that requires additional setup steps beyond simply installing the package via npm or yarn.  The error itself might not directly pinpoint the issue, making debugging challenging.  It often manifests as a runtime error during app initialization or when you attempt to utilize the problematic library's functionality.  For instance, attempting to access methods of a native camera module before it's correctly integrated with your Expo app could produce this cryptic error.  Another cause could be incorrect configuration of your project's build process, leading to compatibility issues with the native modules.
