The solution involves ensuring the native module is correctly linked and configured within the Expo project.  This often means verifying that the necessary native dependencies are installed, any required configurations are set up, and that the module is imported and used correctly within your Javascript code. 
Here's how you might address the problem:
1. **Verify Installation**: Double-check that the native module is properly installed using `npm list <module-name>` or `yarn why <module-name>`. Make sure there are no version conflicts.
2. **Review Dependencies**: Examine the native module's documentation for any additional dependencies it might require. You might need to install these separately.
3. **Check Expo Compatibility**: Verify that the native module is compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Consult the module's documentation or the Expo documentation for compatibility information.
4. **Proper Import and Usage**: Confirm that you are importing and using the native module correctly in your JavaScript code, making sure the API calls are appropriate and timed correctly to avoid asynchronous issues. 
5. **Examine Build Logs**: If possible, examine the build logs or console output during the app build or start process. It might reveal subtle errors related to native module integration.
