# Expo CLI: Cryptic Runtime Error with Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive error encountered when integrating native modules with Expo. The issue manifests as a cryptic runtime error, lacking specific details about the root cause.

## Problem Description

When working with native modules in Expo, you might encounter a runtime error that isn't easily debuggable.  The error message itself often lacks specifics, making it challenging to identify the underlying problem.  This is frequently caused by incorrect configuration of the native module or incompatibility between the module and your Expo project setup.

## Solution

The solution typically involves carefully verifying the module's integration steps, confirming all necessary dependencies are installed and configured correctly, and ensuring the project's build process is compatible with the module's requirements.  This often involves checking documentation, verifying package versions, and possibly examining build logs for more detailed hints.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `expo start`
4. Observe the runtime error.
5. Compare the initial `bug.js` and corrected `bugSolution.js` to understand the resolution.
